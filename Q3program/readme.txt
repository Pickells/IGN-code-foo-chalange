in this question there are 2 ways for the knight to cover the chess board :

1- if for each possition the knight STOPS on is the only possition that the knight covers,
   that means the min moves to cover the chess board is 63 moves.

2- each move the knight makes he will pass through 2 spaces and stops on the 3ed, if all 
   those possitions are covered then the knight only needs 21 moves to cover the chess 
   board.

file "A" has the first way and "B" has the other, enjoy.
