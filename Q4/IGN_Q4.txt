Can a fish swim ? 
Can a dog bark ? 
Can a human breath ?
Can i meet and exceed your values ?

well, all the questions above have the same answer which is "well Duuh .. of course ".

what im trying to say is that who doesn't want to work for IGN, and this opportunity is 
a chance that only a fool would let it pass ( i couldn't sleep when i saw the job app 
that night ), and if i get chosen (Man that would be the best thing that ever happened 
to me) i would be living a dream, not a dream come true coz once a dream comes true, the 
passion towards that dream would be lost, so i will do whatever it takes to keep living 
that dream.

and beside, im willing to leave my country, family and friends for this opportunity, so 
HELL YEAH I'M PASSIONATE. and by saying that i will give all my time for IGN 
without distractions, coz IGN will be my new life, i will eat, drink and breath IGN. 

if you want to ask about my creativity, i always think outside the circle that is outside
the box, and as for solving problems, i think of as many solutions as possible and choose
the best one, and if i face a problem i always make my way around it ( just like Q3, it 
can be understood in 2 ways so i solved both ).

as for why would you choose me, well lets say that if there was two of me the world would 
be messed up, so get ahold of me before something happens … J/K :P
but if you want a guy with a new way of thinking, that have a different way of approaching 
goals and with some wacky ideas that may work, who would be better than a Kuwaiti dude as 
myself.

and if some people think "this middle eastern is going to be lazy and won't be good 
enough", then im here to prove them wrong.

lastly, thanx for your time for reading this and i hope i made a good impression, 
and if all goes well i will be waiting for your call ( i know i won't sleep on June 17th ), 
and please, i only want a chance.
